/**
 * The reader's standing orders, as rows they can close.
 *
 * SILENT WHEN EMPTY WHERE IT IS PASSING THROUGH, by design: most readers
 * will never place one, and a permanent "Open orders (0)" header on a feed
 * would charge everybody rent for a feature a few use.
 *
 * ON THE READER'S OWN PROFILE that reasoning inverts. Someone who goes
 * looking for their orders and finds nothing at all cannot tell "you have
 * none" from "this product does not do that" — which is exactly the report
 * that put this component on the profile in the first place. `showEmpty`
 * says one quiet line there, and nowhere else.
 *
 * The `gated` badge is the rule the backend enforces on its side of the seam:
 * §7's verdict moves, and a mint that has since fallen out of the gate closes
 * the ENTRANCE, not the EXIT. The order stays listed, the reason is stated,
 * and Cancel keeps working — never auto-cancelled, never hidden.
 *
 * Cancel is an ON-CHAIN act (the escrow returns to the wallet), so it gets
 * the same two-beat treatment as a trade: an inline "Cancel?" confirm, then
 * a pending spinner until the transaction is sent. No modal — a modal for a
 * row-level action is a dialog tax the panel does not charge anywhere else.
