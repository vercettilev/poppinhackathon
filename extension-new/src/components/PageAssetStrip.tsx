/**
 * The page's most relevant tradeable asset, at the top of its ONE feed.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS SITS ABOVE THE FEED ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The panel used to split into Posts and Trades tabs, and the split was
 * fragmentation, not structure: the feed already carried the trade receipts
 * (on_chain posts), so the Trades tab re-served data the reader was already
 * looking at, one tap away. The owner's call — one feed per page, the money
 * question answered once at the top — is also the CARD's own architecture:
 * market first, conversation under it. This strip is the panel agreeing with
 * the card.
 *
 * ── THE BUTTONS TRADE HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Buy and Sell open TradeSheet in place. The sidebar is the app: it never
 * sends a reader to the page card to finish something it started.
 *
 * ── WHY IT HOLDS ITS SPACE BEFORE IT HAS AN ANSWER ──────────────────────────
 * Reported as "the card and the logo load slower than the feed, it isn't
 * smooth" — and it was not a speed problem, it was a LAYOUT one. The feed is
 * one request; this card is three (page candidates through the content
 * script, then by-mint, then the logo's own image), so the feed painted
 * first and the card shoved it down on arrival.
 *
 * So the strip now says which of three things it is. Asking (undefined) → a
 * skeleton of the card's exact shape, and the feed starts where it will
 * stay. No asset (null) → nothing at all, collapsed. An answer → drawn into
 * the space already held. The sparkline's slot stays reserved until by-mint
 * answers for the same reason, and the logo fades over its initial instead
 * of popping in.
 *
 * Two module caches make the second visit instant: the panel remounts on
 * every tab switch, and re-asking a question already answered is the other
 * half of what "not smooth" felt like.
