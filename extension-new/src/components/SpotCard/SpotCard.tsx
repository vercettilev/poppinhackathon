/**
 * The spot trade card. One asset, one action — two when the reader actually
 * holds the asset.
 *
 * ── COLLAPSED: WHAT A PERSON GLANCES AT ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Identity on the left (human name over ticker), the MARKET on the right —
 * and the price is the largest type on the card. The name is recognition;
 * the number is the story, which is the hierarchy every trading surface a
 * reader already trusts uses. The 24h move renders as a tinted chip, signed
 * ("+2.1%"), never glowing text. "SPCX · issued by Backpack Securities" was
 * a cataloguing detail wearing the headline's clothes; the issuer line still
 * exists — in the panel, as fine print at the decision.
 *
 * The display name is CURATED (catalog displayName), never derived: deriving
 * from the ticker gives "SPCX", deriving from the registered name gives
 * "Circle Internet Group" on a surface with room for one word.
 *
 * ── ACTIONS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Buy and Sell, ALWAYS, and the reasoning reversed on the owner's call.
 *
 * This read: "Sell only when the balance is > 0 — a sell button for
 * something not held is dead weight." That misreads what an absent button
 * says. It does not read as "you hold none of this"; it reads as "this
 * product cannot sell". A capability the reader cannot see is one they do
 * not believe in, which costs far more than a quiet second key.
 *
 * The chip in the feed was corrected first and this followed, because half
 * a correction is worse than none: a reader who sees Sell on the row and
 * then loses it on the card learns that the button comes and goes for
 * reasons they cannot predict. Pressing it with nothing held is answered
 * by the sheet, which knows how to say "nothing to sell".
 *
 * ── THE PANEL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Keypad order, top to bottom: the amount (largest element, centered,
 * focused on arrival), preset chips under it, the quote line, the CTA, the
 * disclosures as fine print last. The question first, suggested answers
 * second, consequences third, paperwork at the bottom.
 *
 * ── MOTION ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An arrival, 150–200ms ease-out on state changes, a 3% press scale, and one
 * earned success moment (a check that draws itself when a fill CONFIRMS —
 * feedback for a decision already made, which is exactly the line between
 * celebration and pressure). No pulse, no blink, no countdown, no
 * manufactured urgency — this surface offers a securities trade, and motion
 * that pressures is §1's adware in animation form. The idle drift pauses
 * under the cursor and while any panel is open: targets hold still.

 * The Poppin mark: white ghost inside a blue disc.
 *
 * That composition is the product's app icon (public/icons/logo.png), and it
 * is the canonical mark — sampling it gives #68C6FF for the disc, which is the
 * accent this card already uses, so the palette and the logo were the same
 * decision all along.
 *
 * Built here rather than shipped as the PNG: an <img> to a
 * web_accessible_resource is a fetch a page's CSP can refuse, and a logo that
 * sometimes fails to appear is worse than none. The ghost paths come from
 * logo.svg VERBATIM (an earlier version retyped and truncated one, drawing
 * nonsense) and are scaled to sit inside the disc.
 *
 * Two earlier attempts got this wrong in ways worth naming: LogoWithoutEye.svg
 * is the eyeless variant and reads as an anonymous blob, and the ghost alone
 * with no disc is not the mark either. Check both if it ever looks generic.

/**
 * The collapsed state: a small tab on the page's right edge.
 *
 * WHY THE CARD IS NOT ALWAYS OPEN. This thing is a guest on somebody else's
 * page, and a full trade panel that arrives uninvited is the shape a store
 * reviewer reads as adware — the same objection the motion rules answer, one
 * level up. It also caused a real bug: on CoinMarketCap the open card landed
 * on top of that site's own fixed sidebar and the two read as one broken
 * widget. A tab cannot collide with anything.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO THE LATENCY FIX. The tab needs a match and nothing else, so it
 * can be on screen while the quote, the balance and the day's shape are
 * still in flight; opening it later costs nothing because that work is long
 * done. What a person waits for stops being the slowest request.
 *
 * NO IDLE ANIMATION. It pulses when something HAPPENED on this page and at
 * no other time. A permanent tab that breathes on a timer is the perpetual
 * orbit this card already removed once: motion is a claim that something
 * occurred, and a claim that repeats regardless is filtered out within a
 * day — taking the one moment that mattered with it.
 *
 * AND IT RETREATS. The first pass parked a fully opaque logo at the vertical
 * centre of every matching page, forever. Read that back as somebody
 * watching a video: our mark is sitting in the middle of their screen, on
 * content they came for, and there is no version of that which is not rude.
 * An "edge trigger" that is entirely on screen is not an edge trigger, it is
 * a badge. So it arrives visible, settles into the edge a few seconds later
 * (mount.tsx owns that timer), and comes back on hover or when a voice
 * arrives. Fullscreen removes it outright — see mount.tsx.
