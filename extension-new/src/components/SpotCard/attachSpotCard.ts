 * Wait until the page has something worth reading — then go, immediately.
 *
 * This replaces a flat 1500ms setTimeout in the content script. Together
 * with moving injection off the `load` event (see the onUpdated listener in
 * background/main.ts), it is the whole of the card's latency fix: measured
 * on CoinGecko, the old path did not START until 3915ms, then waited 1500ms
 * more, then spent 461ms on the network.
 *
 * The old delay existed for a real reason and that reason is kept: a heavy
 * or SPA page can look loaded while <main> is still being injected, and
 * scraping then yields almost no keywords and no match. But the thing it was
 * actually waiting for is exactly what harvest() already tests — enough text
 * to judge — so testing the condition directly is both faster and more
 * honest than guessing at a duration.
 *
 * TWO CONDITIONS, NOT ONE. Text alone is not enough now that injection
 * happens at navigation commit rather than after load: at 150ms an app shell
 * can already carry 400 characters of nav and footer while its real content
 * is empty, and matching a page's chrome is how you show a card for the
 * wrong asset. `readyState !== "loading"` means the parser is done with the
 * document it was given, so the two together mean "parsed AND has content"
 * rather than "caught mid-parse with a menu in view".
 *
 * ...WITH A FAST PATH, because waiting for the full parse is the single
 * biggest remaining cost on a server-rendered page. HTML streams: CoinGecko's
 * article text is in the document long before the parser reaches the end of
 * it, and holding the match until domInteractive spent about half a second
 * staring at text we already had.
 *
 * The fast path asks for two things a nav shell does not have together: a
 * lot of text, and a headline. A mega-menu can reach a few hundred
 * characters; it does not reach ABUNDANT_TEXT and also carry an <h1>. A page
 * with neither simply waits for the parse, which is the old behaviour.
 *
 * The ceiling is long and that is deliberate. It is not a deadline for the
 * card, it is the point where we stop asking — and on a page that never
 * renders text the answer was always going to be no card. Resolving early
 * costs a missed match; waiting costs nothing, because the moment text
 * appears this fires.
 *
 * Cost: one innerText read per tick, which forces layout. That is why this
 * polls rather than watching the DOM — a subtree MutationObserver is what
 * made this extension unusable on dynamic sites before (see the note in
 * contentScript/primary/main.tsx). A page that renders normally is a handful
 * of reads; one that never does is reading an almost-empty body.

 * Does this reader get the CARD, or just the tab?

 * right about the product: a trade panel that opens itself on somebody
 * else's page is the shape a store reviewer reads as adware, and it is what
 * collided with CoinMarketCap's own sidebar. Push is right about the
 * business: Poppin's whole value is the moment you learn you can trade the
 * thing you were already reading about, and an edge tab nobody has learned
 * yet is an edge tab nobody opens.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS "WHEN WE ARE ACTUALLY RIGHT", and the backend now says so
 * outright. `certainty: "exact"` means the page's identity was READ — a
 * venue's dedicated URL for the asset, or the page printing its own mint —
 * rather than inferred from its prose. Interrupting a reader on a page that
 * IS the asset is a service; interrupting them on a news story that mentions
 * it is the thing everybody hates.
 *
 * THIS REPLACED A COUNTER, and the counter deserved to go. It opened the
 * card on the first three visits to each hostname, which is to say it
 * treated a perfect match on a dedicated coin page exactly like a marginal
 * one on an article, and promised to interrupt three times whether or not we
 * had earned it. A threshold on `score` would have been no better: the score
 * is an unbounded weighted sum, so any cut-off would have been a number
 * nobody could defend.
 *
 * An older backend sends no `certainty` at all, which reads as inferred —
 * the quiet behaviour, which is the right way to fail.
