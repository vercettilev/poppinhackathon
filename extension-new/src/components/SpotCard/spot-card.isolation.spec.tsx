 * The card is the one surface a reader ever sees, and the one piece a normal
 * unit test cannot cover: it lives inside a shadow root, on a page whose CSS is
 * written by someone else and is frequently hostile.
 *
 * poppin-v2 checked this with a browser harness — a page with deliberately
 * aggressive styling (Comic Sans on `*`, `!important` everywhere, borders on
 * every div) and a human looking at the result. This is that harness as an
 * assertion: the same hostile rules, applied to the same card, with the
 * outcome checked rather than eyeballed.
 *
 * WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT PROVE. jsdom implements shadow DOM attachment and
 * scoping but not cascade or layout, so "the card renders at 13px" is not
 * assertable here. What IS assertable, and is what actually broke in practice:
 * that the boundary EXISTS, that it is CLOSED, that page rules are not inside
 * it, and that our own stylesheet is. A regression in any of those is how page
 * CSS gets in, and none of them needs layout to detect.
