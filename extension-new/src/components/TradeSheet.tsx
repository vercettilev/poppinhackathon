/**
 * The panel's OWN money UI.
 *
 * ── THE RULE THIS REVERSES, ON THE OWNER'S CALL ─────────────────────────────
 * For its whole life the panel deferred to the page card: "the panel never
 * grows a second Buy" was written into three files, and Buy here used to mean
 * "open the card over there". The owner reversed it in plain words — the
 * SIDEBAR is the app; the sidebar never redirects to the card; the card may
 * occasionally point at the sidebar. So this sheet owns the full flow.
 *
 * What did NOT change is where the rules come from. This is the page card's
 * TradePanel translated into the panel's hand — same endpoints, same
 * sequence, and the same honesty rules, each of which was earned the hard
 * way over there:
 *
 *   - a preset tap is a COMPLETE answer: Confirm arms immediately, the build
 *     path re-quotes and simulates before anything is signed
 *   - only the NEWEST quote may write to the screen (keystrokes outrun the
 *     network)
 *   - an outcome is retired the moment the reader touches the amount or the
 *     side — a finished trade must not hold the next one hostage
 *   - sell math never invents decimals: raw units, proportional over the
 *     known balance, clamped so Max cannot oversell
 *   - dry run says so out loud; "unknown" settlement is not "failed"
