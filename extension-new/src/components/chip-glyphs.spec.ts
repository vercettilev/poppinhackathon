/**
 * FOUR ICONS FROM FOUR DIFFERENT DRAWINGS, MADE INTO ONE SET.
 *
 * The owner handed over four SVGs — like, comment, share and the Solana mark
 * for tip — and asked for them in the post row: "bu postlardaki alttaki like
 * comment tip ve share iconlarini verdigim iconlarla degistir", plus "like ve
 * liked bos dolu olarak", plus a complaint that the row's icon sizes and
 * alignment were wrong.
 *
 * The files were drawn to four unrelated conventions: a 1025-unit box with
 * the art running edge to edge, two 24-unit boxes whose art fills 75% and 58%
 * of them, and a 25-unit box at 80%. Dropped into equal squares that is four
 * different-looking icons, which is the defect being fixed, not a fix. So
 * chipGlyphs.ts declares each glyph's INK BOX and re-frames it.
 *
 * That makes the ink boxes load-bearing numbers that were read off path data
 * by a human, and a wrong one produces an icon that is off-centre or the
 * wrong size with nothing failing. `hull` below is the check: it walks the
 * path and takes the extent of every point in it. Because Bezier control
 * points can sit outside the curve they steer, the hull is a SUPERSET of the
 * true ink — so it can prove a declared box is not too big, and it bounds how
 * far off a too-small one can be. It is a guard against a typo, not a
 * rasteriser.
