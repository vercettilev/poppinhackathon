/**
 * THE FEED'S LABEL WEARS THE SITE'S FACE, AND THE BOX IS ONLY AS WIDE AS THE
 * NAME INSIDE IT.
 *
 * Two things the owner asked for on the feed row, in one sentence: "we used
 * to pull the website's favicon and put it as a round icon in front of the
 * site name — make it fit that. That box shouldn't be long, only as wide as
 * it needs to be."
 *
 * Both halves had a defender in the source. The mark had a comment arguing
 * that "a URL and a hostname are their own icons, so the two page-scoped
 * branches add nothing rather than inventing a mark". The width had a louder
 * one: a paragraph headed "minWidth 183px STAYS", which grounded the floor in
 * a cross-screen width contract shared with views/tasks.tsx and a
 * components/PageTitle.tsx that nothing in src imported. Half of that
 * contract rendered on no screen — PageTitle has since been deleted as dead
 * code — and the owner overruled the other half.
 *
 * This file is here because a repo whose comments argue for the opposite of
 * its code is the failure mode that costs the most to read, and because both
 * of these are the kind of change a later "let's make the header pills
 * consistent" pass would undo by accident.
