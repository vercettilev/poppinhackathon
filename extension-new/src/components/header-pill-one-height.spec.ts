/**
 * EVERY HEADER LABEL IS THE SAME HEIGHT, OR THE LABEL JUMPS WHEN YOU CHANGE
 * SCREENS.
 *
 * That is HeaderPill's whole reason to exist — its own header says so: "the
 * header always sits at the same y-coordinate as you switch tabs". It was not
 * true. The component defaulted to 10px of side padding and 4px top and
 * bottom, and then:
 *
 *   the feed's label  overrode to 13px sides and trimmed to 3px  -> 26px tall
 *   the Tasks label   overrode to 13px sides, kept 4px           -> 30px tall
 *                     (its bell was a 20px box in an 18px line box)
 *   PageInfoBar       took the default                           -> 28px tall
 *                     (deleted since — it had no importer in src)
 *
 * Three pills, three heights, and the shared contract was the one shape none
 * of them wore. The owner reported it from the outside — "eksiklik varsa
 * diger ekranlarla eslesmeyen onlari da duzelt" (if anything does not match
 * the other screens, fix that too).
 *
 * The fix was to move what the call sites already agreed on (13px sides) and
 * the owner's trim (3px) into the default, and delete the overrides. This
 * spec is what stops the next call site reopening the drift, because the
 * override door is how it got in — not copy-paste.
 *
 * WHY SOURCE GUARDS: jsdom has no cascade and no layout, so it cannot be
 * asked what a pill measures. What can be pinned is the declaration, and the
 * declaration is where the drift was written.
