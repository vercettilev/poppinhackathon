/**
 * A HEADER LABEL IS A PILL ON THE GROUND, NOT A HOLE IN IT.
 *
 * HeaderPill exists so every "where am I" chip in the panel wears one
 * surface: JUICE.well over a JUICE.border hairline. It also takes a `bg`
 * override, and the feed's "Global Feed" pill used it to paint solid #000.
 * That was defensible once — the panel canvas really was #000 and a black
 * pill read as stitched into the page. The canvas has been BRAND_GROUND for
 * a while now (a blue-cast near-black under two accent auroras,
 * helpers/brandGround.ts), so an opaque fill on it reads as a hole punched
 * in a lit room. It shipped that way for months because nothing said
 * otherwise, and the file even carried a dead styled() whose comment still
 * called the canvas #000.
 *
 * `bg` is HeaderPill's own prop name and nothing else in src uses it, so a
 * sweep for an opaque hex on any `bg=` is, in practice, the HeaderPill
 * sweep. Comments are stripped first — the call sites that were fixed had to
 * KEEP the old value in prose to explain why it went.

/**
 * THERE IS NO ALLOWLIST HERE, AND THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THE ONE THERE WAS.
 *
 * The first version of this spec skipped `views/tasks.tsx` and explained the
 * skip by saying the file "belongs to another agent in this working tree".
 * That was not true — nothing was editing it — and the shape of the mistake
 * matters more than the fact: the one file the sweep would have caught was
 * the one file the sweep was told to skip, so the headline assertion below
 * went green by excluding its only counter-example while its sentence ("no
 * call site paints a header pill an opaque colour") still read as a claim
 * about the whole tree. A green suite that says something false is worse than
 * a red one that says something true.
 *
 * The Tasks pill has since dropped its `bg="#000"` (views/tasks.tsx), so the
 * sweep passes on the whole tree. If a future call site needs an opaque fill,
 * the answer is a named token in theme/juice.ts and a widened rule here — not
 * a file name on a skip list.

   * that "the feed pill deviates by 1px per side on purpose; the shared
   * default must not". Held together, they pinned a state where the shared
   * contract was a height NOTHING on screen wore: the feed's label was 26px,
   * the Tasks label 30px (its bell was a 20px box inside an 18px line box),
   * and PageInfoBar — then the only pill still taking the default — 28px.
   * (PageInfoBar has since been deleted; nothing in src imported it.) Both
   * rendered pills also overrode the sides to 13px, so the default was the
   * odd one out there too.
   *
   * The owner reported it from the outside as part of the site-label pass:
   * "eksiklik varsa diğer ekranlarla eşleşmeyen onları da düzelt". The trim
   * and the 13px both moved into HeaderPill and every override was deleted,
   * which is why the assertion above now reads the component instead of the
   * call site, and why the second test is gone rather than inverted — "one
   * height everywhere" is asserted properly, with the sweep that finds new
   * call sites, in components/header-pill-one-height.spec.ts.
