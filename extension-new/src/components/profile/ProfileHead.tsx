/**
 * Who this is — identity with its one action, and four numbers.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS REPLACED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A banner-height header with a floating avatar, an absolutely-positioned
 * back button at z-index 9999999, and a bio whose measured height was written
 * into a global store so five sibling tabs could subtract it from 100vh. The
 * page below now scrolls as one document, so nothing needs to know how tall
 * anything else is.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE ACTIONS LIVE, AND WHY IT IS TWO PLACES ────────────────────────
 * "Edit profile" rides the username on the identity row. It is a property OF
 * the person on screen and it is the only control your own page has, so
 * giving it a line of its own bought nothing.
 *
 * Back and the follow controls share a row ABOVE the avatar, and that row is
 * rendered only when something is standing in it (`showActionRow`). On YOUR
 * OWN profile there is neither, whichever door you came through: your page is
 * a destination and gets no arrow (see profileEntry), and you do not follow
 * yourself. The row rendered anyway as an empty 32px band: the reserved
 * gutter the owner asked us to delete. So the row above the avatar is now
 * somebody else's row, entirely.
 *
 * The four counts are not tabs. Posts and Replies drive the feed's filter
 * right below; Followers and Following open a sheet. A number you can tap is
 * a better affordance than a tab bar that hides four fifths of itself.

   * you) and the follow controls. `!isOwnProfile` is kept alongside `onBack`
