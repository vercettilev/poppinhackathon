/**
 * "YOUR MONEY IS GONE" — the sentence this card was accidentally saying.
 *
 * From the field, with a screenshot: a reader holding $493.95 of USDC and
 * $1.73 of WIF saw "$1.73" in 26px type under the word PORTFOLIO, with the
 * cash a grey caption underneath. The number was book.totalUsd, which is
 * the tokens alone.
 *
 * A total that leaves out the largest component is not a total. On a
 * product whose entire thesis is that USDC IS the money — the deposit
 * screens, the wallet header, the chip's scoreboard were all corrected for
 * exactly this — the one surface a person opens to check on themselves was
 * still reporting only the half they cannot spend.
