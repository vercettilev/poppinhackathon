/**
 * THE ERRORS PANEL HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING.
 *
 * On startup and on install the worker walks every open tab and injects.
 * Chrome refuses some of them by policy — the extensions gallery above all,
 * which cannot be scripted even with <all_urls> — and the refusal used to be
 * caught and then written with console.error. A console.error from a service
 * worker lands in chrome://extensions' own Errors list, so an ordinary
 * browser with the Web Store open painted that button red on every reload.
 *
 * The report that produced this was exactly that: two entries, both
 * "Failed to inject content scripts into tab ...", one for the gallery and
 * one for a host outside the granted set. Neither was a defect. Both buried
 * the panel's only job, which is to be believable when something IS wrong.
 *
 * This spec reads the source rather than the behaviour because the whole
 * point is a LIST, and a list is the kind of thing that quietly loses an
 * entry in a refactor. Comments are stripped before asserting: a guard its
 * own documentation can satisfy is not a guard.
