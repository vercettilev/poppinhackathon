/**
 * THE CHIP'S GEOMETRY, AS RELATIONSHIPS RATHER THAN AS NUMBERS.
 *
 * Two things the owner looked at and rejected, both of them shape rather
 * than colour, and both of them provable from the stylesheet alone:
 *
 *   1. The ticker and the price were STACKED (a column named `.stack`).
 *      Side by side was asked for; the column is reversed here.
 *   2. Expanded, the Buy and Sell keys touched the chip's outer frame.
 *      Nothing between the frame and the keys declared any horizontal
 *      padding, so the last key's border box sat exactly on the frame's
 *      padding box, and the frame's radius could not be concentric with
 *      the keys' at any inset because it was the wrong radius.
 *
 * The numbers are DERIVED, so this file asserts the derivations and not the
 * digits. A future pass is allowed to change the row height, the key
 * padding or the frame radius; it is not allowed to change one of them and
 * leave the other two behind, which is exactly how the flush corner
 * happened in the first place. Source text rather than a mounted root on
 * purpose: jsdom has no layout, so the only honest place to check a
 * geometric invariant is the rule that decides it.

     * to let the identity pay for the width".
     *
     * That declaration is a MITIGATION, not an invariant, and pinning it
     * pinned the row's ability to overlap itself. Freezing the ticker never
     * made room; it moved the failure — with every child of `.face` frozen
     * and no ancestor clipping (`.pair`, `.face`, `.lead` and `.chip` all
     * overflow: visible), a squeeze has to leave the box, and what leaves
     * is a 15px 800-weight price painting across `.end` and showing through
     * `.sell`'s translucent ground. It was affordable while the same pass
     * that froze the ticker also took MC off the face and left 50-60px of
     * slack. Putting the ticker back beside the price spends 26-60px of
     * that slack, on a row `.end`'s own comment records as having WANTED
     * 511px inside a ~500px column, so the overlap is not hypothetical.
     *
     * What is pinned instead is the FAILURE MODE, which is the thing that
     * actually has to hold at any width: the ticker loses letters to an
     * ellipsis, the price loses nothing, and nothing in the pair can paint
     * outside it. The ticker giving way is not the old bug returning — in
     * the old bug it gave way FIRST, while MC was still on the row; here
     * it is the last pixel available before the row would have to overlap.
     *
     * AND THE PAIR IS ONLY THE FIRST STAGE. The version of this test that
     * shipped with the pair's clip was titled "can never paint over the
     * keys" and asserted nothing of the sort: every assertion below the
     * title described what happens INSIDE `.pair`, and `.face` — which
     * also carries `min-width: 0`, and so also loses its automatic minimum
     * size — declared no overflow at all. Once the pair hits zero the
     * algorithm keeps shrinking `.face` past `.badge + .chg + .mine +
     * .who`, all four of which are frozen (assertion 4), and frozen
     * children in a box too small for them lay out from main-start and
     * overflow RIGHT: over `.more` and into `.end`. Assertion 5 is what
     * makes the second half of the title true, and `.face` is the last
     * ancestor that can make it true without a cost — `.lead` above it is
     * the parent of two buttons, and clipping there would clip their focus
     * outlines too.
     *
     * What this test does NOT claim: that the left capsule as a WHOLE can
     * never reach `.end`. `.more` is `.face`'s SIBLING at a fixed 30px, so
     * if `.lead` were ever squeezed below 30px the chevron itself would
     * overflow it. Assertion 6 says how narrow the row has to get for that,
     * from the declarations rather than from a claim. Say so, rather than
     * let a title imply the whole capsule was measured.

// CORRECTED, and the assertion outlived the reason for it.
//
// This was written when a light page made the CHIP paint a ground: the
// chip spans the post's text column, which is right on a feed and
// invisible without a ground, and the moment it painted one that width
// became a dark bar drawn across an article. The ground has since moved
// off the chip and onto the individual keys (see xStrip's "WHEN THE PAGE
// WILL NOT LEND A GROUND"), because the capsule it created wrapped the
// price, Buy and Sell into one control on a row whose whole language is
// separate keys.
//
// The hug stays, for the reason that was always underneath the first one:
// a feed gives the chip a text column to belong to and an article does
// not, so on an article it takes the width its keys occupy and leaves the
// rest of the line to the page.
