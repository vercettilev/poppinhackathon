/**
 * "THE BOX KEEPS CLOSING AND RE-OPENING WHILE I MOVE THE MOUSE."
 *
 * Reported against the buy/sell end of the chip, moving between buttons.
 * Nothing in xStrip.ts listens for hover and the MutationObserver watches
 * childList only, so the question is narrow: what on this surface can a
 * bare pointer MOVE open, close, or rebuild?
 *
 *   1. A NATIVE TOOLTIP. `title` is a box the browser opens on a dwell,
 *      hides the moment the pointer moves, and opens again with different
 *      text over the next element that has one — and the tail is four
 *      controls inside ~150px. This is the reported symptom, literally, in
 *      the reported place. The first repair removed the title from the
 *      HOST only and left Buy, the bell, the wallet and the thin mark
 *      carrying their own, which is where a child's title always won
 *      anyway; the tail is empty of them now and the names live on
 *      aria-label. Pinned below, per element, including the accessible
 *      names that had to survive the removal.
 *   2. A FLIP REBUILT THE TAIL. Buy↔Sell and Now↔When-it-hits rebuild the
 *      sheet, and the tail's close button was rebuilt with it — destroyed
 *      and faded back in — on every segment tap, under whatever the
 *      pointer was resting on.
 *   3. OUR MOVE EVENTS REACHED X. The host sits inside X's article, X's
 *      cell is a React subtree that re-renders on its own hover state, and
 *      mousemove/pointermove carry no relatedTarget, so shadow retargeting
 *      does not stop them at the host the way it stops mouseover/mouseout
 *      between two of our own controls. They are fenced now.
 *
 * AND ONE THING THAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: a self-heal that re-mounted
 * the chip whenever the identity mark matched and the host was missing. It
 * was written for a removal nobody has ever measured, it cannot produce a
 * hover-triggered symptom at all, and if that removal WERE real and
 * recurring it would have answered with a brand-new host — closed, with
 * its 0.32s entrance — on every idle flush, i.e. several times a second.
 * The tests below pin the absence: one verdict per tweet, and no rebuild
 * under the pointer.

/**
 * A cell shaped the way X actually builds one, INCLUDING the action row.
 *
 * THE PARAGRAPH THAT USED TO BE HERE WAS FALSE, twice over, and it argued
 * for this fixture on both counts. It said "every other fixture in this
 * folder omits `role="group"`, so every other test mounts through the
 * article-level fallback — i.e. through the one placement the
 * reconciliation hazard does not apply to."
 *
 * Neither half survives a read. In xStrip.spec.ts, `withActionRow` builds a
 * div with `role="group"` and appends it to the article, and the `mountOn`
 * beside it calls `ctl.processCell(cell)` — so the action-row branch is
 * already exercised there. Counted by reading the bodies of the "placement
 * on any X layout" describe: five of its seven tests mount through
 * `mountOn`/`withActionRow`; the other two ("falls back to the article when
 * there is no action row" and "takes the rail's width when the host hangs
 * off a railed article") build a cell with no action row on purpose,
 * because the fallback is what they are about. And the "reconciliation
 * hazard" is the premise of the self-heal this file's own header (above)
 * records as never measured and deliberately absent: an argument built on
 * it is arguing from something this file abandoned.
 *
 * The honest reason for the landmark is smaller and does not need a bug.
 * `mountStrip` inserts the host directly after the last `[role="group"]`
 * in the article, and measures the chip's left rail from that same row
 * (its `actionRow` insertion, and the `rail` it feeds a few lines below),
 * falling back to the article and the tweet text only where no such row
 * exists. A fixture without one therefore exercises the fallback rather
 * than the placement X ships on every real tweet — and the first test
 * below asserts `group.nextElementSibling`, which the fallback shape
 * could not even express.
