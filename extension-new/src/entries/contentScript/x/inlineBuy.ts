/**
 * The inline buy — a whole trade inside one row of the feed.
 *
 * The strip's Buy used to open the docked card, which is a context switch at
 * the exact moment someone decided to act: eyes leave the tweet, the card
 * expands elsewhere, the moment cools. This module is the alternative — tap,
 * amount, confirm, done, without the feed ever moving.
 *
 * It is deliberately a MODULE and not markup so the money rules live where
 * tests can hold them. The mapping below is the card's and the panel's, word
 * for word; a third money surface earns its existence only by inheriting the
 * rules the first two paid for:
 *
 *   - dry run says so out loud, and is not dressed as a purchase
 *   - "unknown" settlement is not "failed" — claiming either is guessing
 *     about somebody's money
 *   - 401 is an auth answer, not an error string
 *   - "insufficient" names the fix (top up), not just the problem
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT have: custom amounts and quoting. The three
 * presets ARE the product's answer to "how much" (see tradeMath's history);
 * a reader who wants precision taps into the card, which the strip still
 * offers for Sell. Buy stays two decisions wide.
