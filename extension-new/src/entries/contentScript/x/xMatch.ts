/**
 * Which asset is this tweet about? — answered ON DEVICE.
 *
 * The strip under a tweet exists only if this module says so, and this module
 * never talks to a server: the catalog ships in the bundle (127 rows, a few
 * KB), so the tweet's text is read where it already is — in the reader's DOM.
 * Nothing about what anyone reads leaves the machine unless they tap Buy.
 * That is the privacy posture the panel is still working toward; this feature
 * starts there instead of retrofitting it.
 *
 * ── THREE TIERS, BECAUSE PRECISION IS THE PRODUCT ───────────────────────────
 * A wrong strip is not a neutral miss: a Buy button under an unrelated tweet
 * reads as spam at best and as a sick joke at worst. So the signal is tiered
 * by how much intent it carries:
 *
 *   1. CASHTAG — the author typed `$WIF` and X linkified it. The author
 *      opted the tweet into ticker semantics; highest precision.
 *   2. DOLLAR TEXT — `$WIF` written plain (quotes, screenshots-of-text,
 *      clients that did not linkify). Same authorial mark, no anchor.
 *   3. CURATED NAME — "dogwifhat", "Tesla", "SpaceX" in running text. No
 *      authorial mark, so ONLY names on a hand-kept allowlist qualify.
 *
 * ── WHY THE NAME TIER IS AN ALLOWLIST AND NOT A RULE ────────────────────────
 * The catalog was counted, not guessed at: of 127 rows, dozens have names or
 * tickers that are ordinary words — WOULD, WET, NEST, CLOUD, GRASS, DRIFT,
 * ME, W, IO, ORE, GOAT, TROLL, BEER, PUMP, HYPE. And the worst are not funny:
 * plain "Trump" or "Melania" would put a Buy button under half of political
 * X. No heuristic separates those from "Fartcoin" (unambiguous); a person
 * does, once, below. `sol` is also a Turkish word, which is not hypothetical
 * for this product's first users.
 *
 * ── ONE ANSWER PER TWEET ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "ETH vs SOL" mentions two assets; a strip that picks one is half-wrong
 * either way. The rule: the FIRST cashtag wins (the author's own emphasis
 * order), then the first dollar-text hit, then the first allowlisted name.
 * Deterministic, explainable, and it never shows two strips under one tweet.

 * Handles were excluded from matching outright after "@solana Summit Serbia"
 * put a $SOL chip under somebody's conference plans. That fix was right about
 * @solana and wrong as a general law: a tweet saying "I opened a position on
 * @Backpack" is exactly the reader this feature is for, and it got nothing.

 * ambient — @solana is tagged by every event, every builder, every hackathon,
 * and the tag says nothing about the asset. A project account like @Backpack
 * is tagged when the tweet is about that project. So precision is a property
 * of the handle, and the only honest way to encode that is one row at a time.
 *

 * This list used to hold the bare words `long`, `short`, `hold`, `position`
 * and `chart`, and they were quietly catastrophic. Probed against ordinary

 *

 *   "hold the backpack for me a second"          -> Backpack
 *   "orca whales hold their breath a long time"  -> ORCA

 * Widening the list only made it worse, because the next probe reached the
 * verbs: `bought`, `sold`, `bags`, `pump`, `moon`, `entry`, `portfolio`,

 * "bought a new backpack" is the whole problem in four words.
 *
 * Not one failure came from a word that only exists in markets. So the rule

 * must have NO ordinary-English use at all. Everything else has to earn its
 * meaning from a construction (CONTEXT_PHRASES) or from the author's own $.
 *
 * The cost is real and accepted: "bought grass at the bottom" no longer
 * matches on its own. A miss is quiet; a Buy button under someone's shopping
 * is not. The full probe lives in the spec and is the guard on this list.
