/**
 * THE TOP-UP DOOR, on the surface where it matters: a reader on a tweet with
 * no balance. The chip's contract is small and every part of it is a decision
 * that can silently regress, so each gets a case:
 *
 *   · a page with no wallet must still reach the panel (the old door);
 *   · a closed wallet popup must say nothing and change nothing;
 *   · a successful transfer must report TRUE, because the chip throws away
 *     its cached book on that word alone — reporting true without money
 *     having moved would show a balance that does not exist;
 *   · the amount must cover the buy that prompted it.
