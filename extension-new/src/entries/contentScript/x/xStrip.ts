/**
 * The trade strip under tradeable tweets — the feed itself as the venue.
 *
 * Blinks needed every publisher to stand up an Action endpoint before a
 * timeline could act on anything; that is why it starved. Here the publisher
 * is whoever wrote the tweet, and they already published the only thing we
 * need: the words. The strip turns the mention into the venue, on device,
 * without X or the author being asked.
 *
 * ── EVERYTHING BELOW WAS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED (live x.com, 2026-08-20) ─────
 * · The timeline is HARD-virtualized: ~4-5 `article[data-testid="tweet"]`
 *   exist at any moment, inside `div[data-testid="cellInnerDiv"]` wrappers
 *   that X positions with transforms.
 * · A foreign sibling appended NEXT TO the article survived scrolling away
 *   and back (12k px measured) — React did not reconcile it away. That
 *   measurement is kept for its history and NO LONGER DESCRIBES THIS CODE:
 *   the chip is mounted INSIDE the article now, directly under the tweet's
 *   own action row, because "after the article" landed it below the reply
 *   sort control on a status page (see mountStrip). Inside React's own
 *   subtree there is no such guarantee — a re-render of that subtree can
 *   take a foreign child with it.
 * · At ~40k px the SAME DOM cell came back holding a DIFFERENT tweet, with
 *   the foreign node still attached. X recycles cells.
 *
 * Those two facts are the design's centre, and they pull in opposite
 * directions. A boolean "processed" mark — on the cell, on the article,
 * anywhere — survives recycling exactly like the probe did, and afterwards it
 * vouches for a tweet it never saw. So the mark is an IDENTITY,
 * `data-poppin-x="<statusId>"`, and every pass re-reads the cell's actual
 * permalink: same id, nothing to do; different id, the old strip is torn down
 * and the new tweet judged from scratch. Buy-under-the-wrong-tweet is the one
 * failure this feature cannot survive; it is handled by construction, not by
 * hoping.
 *
 * AND THE MARK IS NOT PAIRED WITH A PRESENCE CHECK — deliberately, after
 * one was written and taken back out. The argument for it: an identity on
 * the CELL cannot see a chip removed from inside the ARTICLE, so if React
 * ever reconciles our host away the mark keeps vouching for a chip that is
 * gone. The argument against it, which wins: nobody has ever measured that
 * happening (the 12k px probe above measured the opposite), while a
 * re-mount on "mark matches, chip missing" is driven by the idle flush at
 * the bottom of this file — up to ~8 times a second — and every re-mount is
 * a brand-new host that arrives CLOSED and replays the 0.32s `stripIn`
 * entrance, plus a fresh TickTarget, walRefresher and clipLabel that only
 * prune on their own next call. If the removal it heals were real and
 * recurring, "the chip vanished once" would become "the chip re-enters
 * three to eight times a second", which is the flicker this file was being
 * repaired for, faster. A silent missing chip until the cell recycles is
 * the cheaper failure. Anyone re-adding the heal owes it a measurement, an
 * attempt cap per cell, and no entrance animation on a heal.
 *
 * ── WHY THE OBSERVER WATCHES EVERYTHING AND DOES ALMOST NOTHING ─────────────
 * X is a SPA; timelines mount and unmount across Home, search, profiles,
 * threads. Chasing the "right" container is a losing game, so the observer
 * watches `document.body` and pays for it by being nearly free per record:
 * map the mutation target to its cell, put the cell in a Set, and flush the
 * Set on idle. Matching itself was measured at 0.1ms for every visible tweet
 * — the budget problem is not the scan, it is doing layout work eagerly,
 * which the idle flush avoids.

 * price: "if it comes off ten percent I want it."
 *
 * A SELL does. Offering "+10%" against the tape tells a holder nothing —
 * if the price is already 30% under what they paid, selling ten percent
 * above today is still a loss, and a control that calls that +10% is lying
 * about the only number that matters. Sell offsets are TAKE-PROFIT targets
 * measured from the average entry, which is what "I'm up ten percent" means

     * NO `title` ON THE RESTING ROW — and this is a bug fix, not tidying.
     *
     * A native tooltip is a BOX the browser opens after a dwell, hides the
     * instant the pointer moves, and opens again with different text over
     * the next element that has one. The tail of this row is four controls
     * (bell · wallet · Buy · Sell) inside about 150px, and a reader
     * choosing between Buy and Sell sweeps across all of them: box, gone,
     * box, gone, different box. Reported exactly that way — "the box keeps
     * closing and re-opening while I move the mouse around the buy/sell
     * area".
     *
     * The first repair removed `host.title = "Poppin"` and moved the name
     * onto the badge, which fixed almost nothing: a child's own title
     * always beat the host's anyway, so the four titles in the tail were
     * the whole symptom and all four survived. The second removed those
     * four — and then EXEMPTED `.mine` and `.who`, on the reasoning that a
     * pointer at that end of the row is reading rather than choosing
     * between keys. Both halves of that exemption were wrong.
     *
     *   POSITION. `.mine` and `.who` are the last children of `.face`,
     *   i.e. the elements immediately before `.more` and then `.end`.
     *   They sit ON the approach to Buy, not at the far end of anything.
     *
     *   THE TIMER, which is worse. `paintMine` rebuilt `.mine`'s children
     *   and reassigned its `title` unconditionally, and `paintMine` runs
     *   from `paintMarket` — the PRICE PAINT. So a reader who HOLDS the
     *   token and dwells on that pill got a box that closed and re-opened
     *   on the tick cadence with the pointer standing perfectly still. A
     *   tooltip needs a movement to flicker; that one needed nothing, and
     *   it was the strongest instance of the very mechanism the previous
     *   pass had diagnosed.
     *
     * So the rule is no longer "no title where the pointer travels", which
     * is a judgement about where a pointer goes and can be argued with. It
     * is: NOTHING ON THE RESTING ROW CARRIES A TITLE — `.row` and every
     * descendant, before and after any number of price ticks. Pinned in
     * chip-stays-put.spec.ts.
     *
     * The names the tail's controls need live on `aria-label`, read aloud
     * on request and drawing no box. The two facts that lived ONLY in a
     * box are not renamed: your exact units and average entry are the
     * first two lines of the position card the face opens — views/TokenView
     * renders "You hold <units> · <value>" and "Average entry <price>" for
     * exactly this holding — and the crowd is already drawn on the row as
     * faces and a count. The follower NAMES are the one thing this removal
     * costs, and a box that opens and shuts on the way to Buy is too much
     * to pay for them.
     *
     * Titles DO remain on the surfaces the reader SUMMONS — the fund
     * panel's address, the chart's view toggle and its trade marks, the
     * sheet's bell and its unverified-token warning, the open-orders hold
     * note. None of those exists until it is opened, and none is on the
     * sweep between the keys.
     *
     * The sheet, though, IS written by a timer, so it is one place
     * `.mine`'s trick — a box blinking at a motionless pointer — could
     * come back.
     * `sheetTick` calls `verdict`, and reading that function through, the
     * nodes it can write on a tick are the reading line, the balance, the
     * message and its row, the primary button's text and class, and each
     * size pick's `aria-pressed`. What keeps the box shut is that none of
     * them carries a title; the bell and the unverified warning do, and
     * the tick does not reach them. Pinned rather than promised —
     * chip-stays-put.spec.ts opens the sheet, ticks it, and fails if a
     * node the tick writes has a title, or if any title in the chip
     * changes across those ticks.

           LIGHT. Three moves carry the whole upgrade:

           1. MATERIAL, NOT FILL. The pill gets a barely-there top light
              (gradient + inset highlight) and a soft drop — the Stripe/
              Apple recipe that makes a surface read as an object.
           2. ONE MEANING PER COLOR. The price sits white; the 24h chip
              alone wears the verdict; the accent exists only on Buy. On a
              live tick the price flashes the DIRECTION OF THAT PRINT —
              green uptick, red downtick, exchange-terminal style — then
              settles back to white. Color is an event, not a state.
           3. MOTION WITH INTENT. One spring entrance, a 150ms crossfade
              between flow states, and a 96% press scale. Nothing loops,
              nothing bounces twice. */

        /* ── THE ORDER SHEET ─────────────────────────────────────────────
           A standing order was being composed inside a 32px pill: a preset
           row, an "@", a 76px number field and a Place button, all on one
           line. Every part was present and none of it was legible, the
           price field was the width of four digits, and the balance — the
           one number that decides whether an order can even be placed —
           was nowhere on screen.

           A limit order is not a smaller buy, it is a different decision:
           the reader is picking a PRICE, which is a number they have to
           read, compare against the current one, and change their mind
           about. That needs room, so the chip opens into it rather than
           compressing it. The pill stays the header, the sheet unfolds
           beneath, and the whole thing is one object the entire time. */
        /* THE SURFACE, once something is open on it. Same object the row
           used to wear all day, now only worn when it is holding
           something. The Dim-theme note still applies and is the reason
           the hairline comes back with the ground rather than after it:
           JUICE.ground is about half the luminance of X's Dim, so a
           ground without an edge reads as a hole. */
        /* 20, AND IT IS DERIVED RATHER THAN CHOSEN. The frame is drawn on
           the BORDER box and the content lives in the PADDING box, so the
           corner the eye actually compares a button against is 20 - 1 (the
           hairline .chip declares) = 19px. The header row is 38px and its
           children are centre-aligned, so a key of any height H is inset
           (38-H)/2 from the top and its own corner is H/2 — and
           (38-H)/2 + H/2 = 19 for EVERY H. 19 is therefore the only
           padding-box radius at which the tail keys can ever be concentric
           with the frame, and 20 is the only border-box radius that gives
           it. At the old 18 no inset value could have made them concentric;
           the reported "corners bleeding into the frame" was the visible
           half of that. */

           Reported: expanded, the Buy and Sell keys touch the chip's outer
           border. They did — .chip, .row and .end between them declared no
           right-hand padding at all, so the last key's border box sat
           exactly on the frame's padding box. At rest that is invisible,
           because .chip paints no ground and no border there; opening
           grows a real ground, a real hairline and a real radius around
           content that was never inset for any of them. And the rule right
           above is why it is these two keys and nothing else: everything
           in the tail gives up its ground when the chip opens, so Buy and
           Sell are the only closed shapes left to collide with the corner.

           OPEN-STATE ONLY, deliberately. .row has run at padding 0 since
           the chip stopped having a shell: the resting row is aligned edge
           to edge with the tweet's own text column (see mountStrip's
           placement pass, which MEASURES that alignment), and padding here
           would push it off that line for the 99% of its life when there
           is no frame to be inset from. Only the open state has a frame.

           4px, which is not a taste either: the keys are locked to 30px
           (see .buy/.sell below) inside a 38px row, so the row's own
           centring already inset them 4px top and bottom. 4px each side is
           what makes that inset the same on all three exposed edges. */

           4px right the instant a chart or a sheet appeared — a snap, on
           the one element on this row whose left edge is supposed to be
           welded to the tweet's text column. The 4px comes back out of
           .face's own 6px, which is free: that padding exists to seat the
           badge inside .lead's capsule, and the rule directly above
           removes that capsule's ground in exactly this state. 4 + 2 = the
           same 6px from the frame the badge sits at when resting, so

           tweet column after a field report clipped a ticker to "BU…", and
           that changing them means re-measuring. So this inset does not
           get to cost the row anything: the 8px .chip.open .row takes is
           given back as the 4px .face no longer needs plus the 4px trimmed
           off this seam, and the open row wants exactly as many pixels as

           .face carries "min-width: 0", and min-width:0 is exactly the
           declaration that removes a flex item's automatic minimum size.
           Once .pair is at zero the algorithm keeps shrinking .face past
           the sum of what is left, and what is left is all frozen:
           .badge (24px, flex-shrink:0), .chg (flex-shrink:0; it ships in
           the markup unhidden, and paintMine hides it in two places —
           once a position exists, and while there is no change figure to
           print — so the case below counts it as present, which is the
           wide side of the question), .mine, .who. Frozen children in a
           box narrower than
           they are lay out from the main-start edge and overflow to the
           RIGHT: over .more, and into .end, where they show through
           .sell's rgba(255,255,255,.05) ground. That is the same failure
           the pair's clip was written for, one level out.

           So the face clips too. The order of surrender is then read
           right-to-left off the markup, and it is the order the row would
           choose: the faces first, then your position, then the day's
           change. Nothing inside this button can reach .end at any width.

           The cut is at the PADDING box, and the 5px top/bottom above is
           what keeps it off anything that MOVES: .px lifts 1.5px on a live
           tick, .pair's own clip already contains that lift, and .pair
           sits inside this box's CONTENT box — so the face's cut is a
           further 5px out from it. Take the vertical padding away and this
           clip starts shaving the pulse — pinned in chip-frame.spec.ts.

           .lead is deliberately NOT clipped: it is the parent of two
           BUTTONS, and an overflow clip on it would also clip their
           2px/1px-offset focus outlines, which is a real loss for a real
           user to fix a squeeze this one already stops. */

           facts at one weight gave the eye nowhere to land". The premise
           was wrong. The two facts are not at one weight and never were —
           10px/700/uppercase/grey against 15px/800/white is the entire
           hierarchy, and it does not depend on which LINE a word sits on.

           What the column actually cost was SHAPE. Stacked, this pair is
           two line boxes (~31px) inside a .face that adds 5px of padding
           top and bottom — a ~41px capsule sitting in a row pinned to 38px
           (.row), taller than the 30px .more/.ring/.wal buttons beside it,
           and outside the 32-34px band .chip up top commits this whole row
           to because it is X's own inline-button scale. Side by side the
           pair is one 18px line box, .face is sized by the 24px badge
           instead (24 + 10 = 34px), and the two facts read as one phrase.
           The row's own height is fixed, so nothing in X's timeline moves.

           CENTRE, NOT BASELINE — a browser fact, not a preference.
           Baseline is the right answer for two type sizes on one line, and
           it is not available here: .sym carries "overflow: hidden" (pinned
           below by a field bug), which makes it a SCROLL CONTAINER, and a
           scroll container does not expose the baseline of its text — the
           engine synthesizes one from its border box, which would hang the
           ticker about 2px high off the price. Centring is what is left,
           and for UPPERCASE beside digits it draws almost the same picture:
           neither has a descender, so the two cap heights centre on one
           axis. It has the second virtue of not caring what line-height
           X's page inherits into "button { font: inherit }".

           5px, deliberately tighter than the 7px .face puts between its own
           children: on one line, proximity is the only thing left saying
           these two facts are one subject.

           And the class is .pair now, not .stack. A rule named "stack" that
           lays out a row is the same kind of lie the comments in this file
           are forbidden to tell.

           ── HOW THIS PAIR IS ALLOWED TO FAIL ─────────────────────────────
           Un-stacking moved the pair's intrinsic width from max(sym, px) to
           sym + 5 + px — about +26px for a short ticker and up to +60px at
           the 9ch cap — on a row .end already records as having WANTED
           511px inside a ~500px X column. So a squeeze is not a hypothesis
           here, it is the measured normal case with the balance warning up,
           and the only question a layout gets to answer is which way it
           breaks.

           It breaks by ELLIPSIS. This box is the shrink target inside
           .face (every other child there declares flex-shrink: 0, and the
           one that declares nothing is an 11px glyph that cannot go below
           its own min-content), it can go to zero, and it CLIPS — so
           nothing inside it can paint over .end and show through .sell's
           translucent ground, which is precisely what happened while the
           pair shrank with overflow visible and both its children refused
           to give a pixel. Inside the clip the ticker is
           the one that yields (see .sym) and the price never does, so the
           first thing a reader loses is letters off a name whose disc is
           still sitting beside it — not digits off a number.

           overflow: hidden, not auto. A clip that ellipsises is honest
           about having run out of room; a scroll container hides a fact
           behind a gesture nobody knows is available.

           And the padding/margin pair is what keeps the clip HORIZONTAL.
           A clip cuts at the PADDING box, so 3px of vertical padding puts
           the top and bottom edges out of the way of anything that moves:
           .px lifts 1.5px on a live tick (tickPulse), and a box clipping at
           the exact top of its line box would shave the digits mid-pulse —
           a clip installed for width quietly eating a movement. The equal
           negative margin hands the 6px straight back, so the pair occupies
           exactly the height it did before and the row does not move.
           Sideways there is no padding, so the ellipsis still bites at the
           first pixel it has to. */

             BACK. Read the whole trade before touching this line.

             "flex-shrink: 0" arrived here with the field report it names.
             The ticker was then a direct child of .face and the only
             shrinkable thing on it, so it paid for every pixel FIRST and
             $SOL arrived as "S…". Freezing it did not create room, it
             MOVED the failure: with every child of .face frozen, a squeeze
             has to leave the box instead. That was affordable because the
             same pass took MC off the face and handed the row 50-60px of
             slack to leave with.

             The slack is spent. Putting the ticker beside the price again
             costs 26-60px (see .pair) on a row .end records as having
             WANTED 511px inside a ~500px column — and "leave the box",
             with nothing on the way out clipping, means the 15px price
             paints across .end and shows through Sell's ground.

             So the ticker narrows again, and the difference from the old
             bug is WHEN. Then it paid first, while MC was still on the
             row: a name giving way for a number nobody had asked for. Now
             it is the last thing left to give — the price never gives, the
             tail never gives — it gives INSIDE a box that clips, and the
             disc to its left still names the asset while the letters are
             short. A shortened name is a legible failure. A price lying
             across the Sell key is not.

             overflow: hidden is doing double duty: it makes the ellipsis
             possible AND it is what lets this flex item shrink below its
             own text (a flex item's automatic minimum size is zero once it
             is not overflow: visible). The 9ch cap stays for the opposite
             direction — a pathological ticker eating the whole row. */

           Reported exactly that way.

           Order of surrender, and it is deliberate: the reader's wallet
           goes first (an aside), then the ticker (the disc still names the
           asset), then the change badge. Buy and Sell are the product; they
           are the last things standing and they never shrink. */
        /* THESE NUMBERS ARE MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN. Field report: a tweet
           for $BULLSHIT showed "BU…" on a row with visible empty space in

           at real column widths, and the row turned out to want 511px
           while X's tweet text column gives about 500.
           
           The first instinct was to change WHO pays — the file's own
           surrender order says the reader's wallet goes first, then the
           ticker, and .end { flex-shrink: 0 } was quietly preventing
           that. Measuring it killed the idea: the wallet is not an aside
           any more. It only appears when the balance cannot cover a
           press, which makes it a warning, and a warning does not give
           way to a word. Letting it shrink just clipped a NUMBER instead
           of a word, which is worse.
           
           So the row was made to want less instead. Trimming the seam,
           the pill paddings and one gap recovers about 20px, and 20px is
           the whole argument: measured at a 500px column with the
           balance warning up, the ticker goes from 37px of the 58 it
           needs to all 58. Every other state gains the same headroom.
           Change these and re-measure, or the ticker starts paying
           again. */

           Fomo's rule, read off their own product: the only filled button
           on their home screen is Deposit, and it is brand blue. Green and
           red never touch a button there. They are what a NUMBER does.

           This row had green meaning two things six pixels apart: "went
           up" on the change pill, and "press here" on the key. Two
           meanings for one hue on one row is why it read as loud without
           reading as clear.

           So the resting row's keys are DOORS and wear the brand. The
           confirm inside the sheet stays green for buy and red for sell,
           because that is the moment direction genuinely is the subject,
           and juice.spec.ts still enforces it there. Same boundary rule 6
           just drew: on X's page we speak carefully, on our own surface we
           speak our language.

           Sell becomes a neutral outline for the same reason. Not quieter

           way the money went.

           This went through a dot first, and the dot failed: it said
           "something happened here" and the reader asked "aldığım yer mi?"
           A mark that needs asking has failed. The answer then was arrows,
           on the reasoning that a shape which POINTS carries direction —
           a buy pointing up at the line from below, a sell down from
           above.

           It is a dot again now, and that is not the failed one coming
           back. The dot that failed had ONE colour and no side at all;
           these are the same green and red as Buy and Sell, three
           surfaces deep by now, so the side is answered before the shape
           is even read. What the arrows were buying was already paid for
           by colour.

           And the shape earns something back. An arrow cannot sit on the
           point it describes — it has to stand 8px off and aim at it, so
           every mark was drawn at a price the reader never traded. A
           circle has no direction to lose, so it sits ON the point: this
           is where your money went in, at this price, at this moment.

           Tokens, not literals. The pair here was #5EC1FF and #FF6B61,
           which is drift — blue never meant "buy" anywhere else on this
           surface. */
        /*
          YOUR FILLS, AS THE WHOLE MARKET DRAWS THEM.
       
          Two dots, one green one red, at nearly the same price minutes
          apart: reported as unreadable, and it was. A circle carries no
          direction, so colour was doing all the work — at eight pixels,
          against a line that is itself green, on a dark plot. Worse, two
          trades close in time landed on top of each other, because both
          sides were anchored the same way.
       
          The convention every terminal shares (TradingView's execution
          markers, which DexScreener and the Solana front ends embed) is an
          ARROW: green pointing up for a buy, red pointing down for a sell,
          aimed at the level. It reads without colour, which is what makes
          it legible at this size.
       
          It also settles the objection that removed arrows from here once
          before: an offset mark "sits at a price the reader never traded".
          True of a shape centred off the level, not of one that POINTS at
          it. THE TIP IS THE TRUTH AND THE BODY IS THE DIRECTION — a buy
          hangs below its price with the tip touching it, a sell hangs
          above. Nothing is drawn at a price nobody traded, and the two
          sides now separate themselves: the pair in that report would sit
          apart, one under the line and one over it, without any nudging.
       
          drop-shadow rather than box-shadow for the dark halo: these are
          border triangles, so their box is 0x0 and a box-shadow would ring
          nothing at all. drop-shadow follows the rendered shape.

     * This began as a limit-order state crammed into the pill's 32px tail:
     * three preset pills, an "@", a 76px number field and Place, on one line.
     * It grew a sheet, and then the shape of the sheet exposed the real
     * problem underneath: MARKET AND LIMIT WERE AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS. A market
     * buy was two taps in the pill; a limit buy was hidden behind a button
     * inside the amount row of that same pill. They are not parent and child,
     * they are the two ways to buy the same thing, and a reader deciding
     * between them was being asked to remember which menu each one lived in.
     *
     * So the sheet carries both axes as siblings, one segmented control each:
     *
     *        Buy | Sell        ← the direction
     *      Market | Limit      ← how the price is chosen
     *
     * Four combinations, one surface, and the answer to "what happens when I
     * press the button" is always readable in the same place. The pill keeps
     * its two-tap market buy: that path is fast and used, and a sheet is the
     * wrong tax on someone who already knows they want $25 of something.
     *
     * WHAT EACH MODE NEEDS is different, and pretending otherwise is what
     * made the old flow illegible. A buy is sized in dollars against a cash
     * balance; a sell is sized as a fraction of a holding, in the raw units
     * the server echoed back. A limit needs a price and the distance to it; a
     * market needs the impact of the size. The sheet shows exactly the fields
     * the chosen combination uses and none of the others.
