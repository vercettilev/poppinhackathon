/**
 * A LIST FROM AN EVENTUALLY CONSISTENT SOURCE IS NEVER ASKED ONCE.
 *
 * Reported: place a standing order, open the You panel, and it is not
 * there. Reload the page and it is. Nothing was cached and nothing failed
 * — the panel fetched the list exactly once, on open, and the source had
 * not caught up yet. /embed/asset/orders reads Jupiter's getTriggerOrders,
 * which indexes the order account after the transaction lands, so the one
 * moment a reader is most likely to look is the one moment the answer is
 * most likely to be stale. Reloading worked because that mounted a new
 * chip, which is not a cure, it is a coincidence.
 *
 * Measured on the reported order: placed, and present at Jupiter at
 * 09:09:04 on 2026-09-14. The source was right. The asking was wrong.
 *
 * Three things hold this shut, and the third is as important as the other
 * two: the retry is BOUNDED. An empty order list is a perfectly ordinary
 * answer, and a panel that keeps polling to disbelieve it is the flicker
 * amplifier the chip's own remount cure was written against.
