/**
 * THE IDENTITY STEP — newborn accounts only, exactly once.
 *
 * First cut of this idea rode on "You're in!" as a pill and was pulled the
 * same day: it made five pressable things out of a screen whose whole
 * argument was two doors and a quiet exit ("çok çok fazla CTA var"). So it
 * became its own step, BETWEEN sign-in and the payoff, and only for
 * accounts minutes old (see helpers/accountAge). Existing users never meet
 * it; the payoff screen is untouched.
 *
 * Second cut sent the two changes AWAY — "Change username" opened another
 * screen, and the photo could not be changed at all. Both were wrong for a
 * screen whose whole promise is "this is you": being shown an identity and
 * then having to travel to amend it is worse than not being shown one.
 * "Beğenmediyse oracıkta foto upload etse veya username seçse" — so the
 * avatar IS the file picker and the handle IS the field, in place.
 *
 * WHAT KEEPS IT FROM BECOMING A FORM: nothing is required and nothing is
 * asked. The account arrives named (assigned at creation) and faced (the
 * Google photo, captured in auth), so the screen renders a finished
 * identity and Continue keeps it — untouched, Continue does not even reach
 * the network. Editing is the exception path, priced accordingly.
 *
 * Connect X stays a door because it genuinely leaves: OAuth is a round
 * trip, not a field.
