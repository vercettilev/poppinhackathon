/**
 * The LAST screen of onboarding V2 — the payoff, third cut.
 *
 * The second cut led with a picture: a mock tweet wearing the chip, then a
 * CTA, then footnote links. Verdict from live use: "çok kötü... screenshottan
 * daha kolay anlaşılır olabilir" — the picture made the reader STUDY when
 * the screen's one job is to make them GO. Lev's own sketch of the fix is
 * this screen: two big doors, no homework.
 *
 *   1. You're in!                          (the celebration)
 *   2. TRADE ON YOUR X FEED  →             (the hero door, X-bound)
 *   3. Or trade on any site  →             (CoinGecko / TradingView / Yahoo)
 *   4. or just start browsing              (the quiet exit)
 *
 * The three demo links keep their history: each was run through the real
 * matcher and then LOOKED at in a real browser before earning its place
 * (CoinMarketCap and Google Finance matched fine and were rejected on
 * sight — their own sidebars live in the exact corner our card claims).
 *
 *     coingecko.com/en/coins/dogwifhat  →  $WIF    (clean)
 *     tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD    →  SOL     score 28  (clean)
 *     finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA      →  TSLAx   score 32  (kept)

        THE GUARANTEED FIRST CHIP.

        The door above says "your X feed" and must keep meaning it - so the
        destination does not change. But whether a chip appears in the first
        screenful depends entirely on the reader's own timeline carrying a
        tweet the matcher admits, and the promise one line above is written
        as a certainty. Somebody who follows nobody in crypto lands on a
        feed with nothing lit and concludes it does not work.
        
        So the certainty gets a place to be true: a live cashtag timeline,
        every tweet on it about the same asset, one tap away. Outside the
        hero button because a button cannot contain another button.
