/**
 * WHAT ONE ROW OF THE ACTIVITY LIST SAYS.
 *
 * Two things were wrong on this list, and both came from the same habit:
 * the number and the unit were fetched from different places and nobody
 * checked they agreed.
 *
 * A swap row read "Swapped Swap" with a bare unlabelled number beside it.
 * The word was a placeholder standing in for a token symbol, and the
 * number was the row's `amount` column, which for a swap is RAW input
 * units (terminal.service writes `quote.inAmount`) while every other
 * writer on that column writes UI units. So a $10 buy rendered as
 * "10000000.00" with nothing after it to say what those were.
 *
 * The fix is not a better label for `amount`. It is to stop reading it:
 * the swap's metadata carries both legs, and under USDC pinning one leg is
 * always USDC, whose 6 decimals are a constant we do not have to look up.
 * That leg is also the one the reader wants — a buy cost dollars, a sell
 * returned them. Works on rows already in the database; no migration.
 *
 * A pre-pinning token-to-token row has no USDC leg and therefore no honest
 * dollar figure. It says what it was and states no amount, rather than
 * picking a side.
 *
 * DIRECTION IS ABOUT THE ROW'S SUBJECT, not about dollars: green when the
 * thing named enters the wallet, red when it leaves. That is the house
 * rule ("green in, red out"), and it keeps Bought/Received on one side and
 * Sold/Sent on the other instead of colouring a buy by what its money did.
