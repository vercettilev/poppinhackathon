 * good message — the good message is INSIDE it, four keys deep.
 *
 * The chain that produces it: ZodPipe throws a ZodError, ZodFilter answers
 * `{ errors, message }` where `message` is ZodError.message (which is the
 * issue array, JSON-stringified), and the extension's background bridge
 * forwards `err.response.data.message` while dropping the structured
 * `errors` beside it. So by the time a screen catches anything, the only
 * thing left IS the JSON string, and every screen that renders
 * `error.message` renders a debugger's view of itself.
 *
 * Rather than teach each screen, this is the one place that knows: pull
 * the first issue's own message back out, and only fall back to a written
 * sentence when there is genuinely nothing to say.
