/**
 * "YOU RECEIVED 1,000 USDC" — the decision half of the deposit watcher,
 * kept pure the way orderFillWatch keeps watchStep pure.
 *
 * The background polls GET /wallets/external-transfers with a cursor (the
 * last signature it has seen); the server answers only traffic Poppin did
 * not create itself — deposits in, external sends out — already classified
 * one-asset-one-direction. This file decides what to SAY about it and how
 * the cursor advances. Asked for in so many words: "poppin hesabıma fund
 * atınca you received 3 sol diye notification gelmesin mi?"
 *
 * Adversarially reviewed before shipping; three of its rules exist because
 * a reviewer broke the first draft:
 *
 * — GENESIS. A fresh wallet has no history, so the seed poll used to learn
 *   nothing and stay in seed state forever — and the seed rule then
 *   swallowed the user's FIRST deposit, the one this feature is for. The
 *   server now says `ok` (looked and saw) separately from `cursor` (what
 *   it saw), and an empty history seeds to GENESIS: everything after it
 *   deserves its toast.
 *
 * — SPOKEN SET. A reorged or lagging RPC node can fail to find the cursor
 *   and answer the newest window as if it were all new. The last spoken
 *   signatures are remembered, and nothing is said twice.
 *
 * — SPEAK RULES. Anybody can send dust or a token whose creator named it
 *   "USDC" to any visible wallet. A toast is Poppin's voice: it speaks
 *   only for money the product can name, above a floor, never for a
 *   symbol impersonating the canon, and at most a few per poll.

 *   after the money; it never speaks.
 * — Below a cent is a knock, not a deposit: USDC under $0.01, priced

 *   too — a toast that cannot say what the amount is worth is exactly
