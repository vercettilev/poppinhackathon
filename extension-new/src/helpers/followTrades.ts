/**
 * WHEN SOMEBODY YOU FOLLOW TRADES — the rulebook that decides whether that
 * becomes a notification or stays a fact.
 *
 * A ping from a person you chose to follow is the strongest signal this
 * product can send, and the fastest way to lose it is to send it every time.
 * A notification that arrives constantly is filtered out within a day, and it
 * takes the one that mattered with it. So four rules, all of them here, all
 * of them testable without a browser:
 *
 * 1. CONSENSUS OVER CHATTER. Trades are grouped by ASSET, not by person.
 *    "Ada and 2 others bought $WIF" is one arrival that says more than three
 *    arrivals ever could — agreement between people is the news, not the
 *    individual act.
 *
 * 2. BUYS INVITE, SELLS INFORM. A buy is something the reader can join in one
 *    tap. A sell is only news if they HOLD the thing, and then it is real
 *    news; a sale of something they do not own is somebody else's business.
 *
 * 3. DUST STAYS QUIET. Below the floor it is not a conviction, it is a tap.
 *
 * 4. RARITY IS ENFORCED, not hoped for. One ping per asset per cooldown, and
 *    a ceiling per round. Both are anchored to what was ALREADY SAID rather
 *    than to what happened, so a loud hour cannot borrow against a quiet one.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: who to follow, when to poll, how to draw it. This
 * file turns rows into decisions and nothing else.
