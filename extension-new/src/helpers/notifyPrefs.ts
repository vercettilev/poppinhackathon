/**
 * WHICH NOTIFICATIONS A READER ACTUALLY WANTS.
 *
 * Five kinds now leave this extension — an order filled, a price you asked
 * about, your own position moving, somebody you follow trading, the morning
 * digest — and until this file there was no way to turn any of them off. A
 * product that can only be silenced by uninstalling it gets uninstalled, and
 * a store reviewer reads an ungovernable notification permission the same
 * way.
 *
 * ── DEFAULT ON, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A TRICK ─────────────────────────────────
 * Every kind here was designed to be rare: fills speak once per fill, alerts
 * once per alert, moves once per ±10% with a re-anchor, the digest once a
 * morning. Something that rare is worth arriving by default, and each of them
 * is one switch away from silence. The honest test is whether a person who
 * turns one off stays turned off — which is why the CHECK lives at the moment
 * of sending, not at the moment of scheduling: a preference read once at
 * startup is a preference that ignores the switch somebody just flipped.
 *
 * ── `social` WAS THE ONE EXCEPTION, AND ITS CONDITION IS MET ────────────────
 * "People you follow" shipped DEFAULT OFF because social proof needs proof:
 * with the user base of the day, a reader who turned it on subscribed to an
 * empty room, and shipping it ON would have spent a permission warning to
 * deliver nothing. That was written down with an END CONDITION rather than
 * as a permanent cut — "turn it on when there is real activity to reflect" —
 * and the owner called it (2026-08-31). It is ON now, like every other kind.
 *
 * What keeps it from being noise is not the switch, it is followTrades'
 * rulebook: a $10 dust floor, one ping per asset per hour, and sells that
 * only speak to somebody who HOLDS the thing. Those are the reason this can
 * be on by default at all.
