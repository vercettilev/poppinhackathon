 * How many browsers hold a live card on this hostname right now.

 * The card's head and the side panel's header both show this number, and they
 * must be the SAME number — two surfaces disagreeing about "who's here" is the
 * exact class of bug this session spent a day undoing for post formatting. So
 * the fetch lives here and both import it.
 *
 * ONE WORD, TOO. Both surfaces say "live", never "online": the header pill is
 * the door to the live chat and the card's line is the same number, so a
 * product that called one "online" and the other "live" would be speaking two
 * words for one fact. Change the word here and change it in both call sites in
 * the same edit — components/Header.tsx and components/SpotCard/SpotCard.tsx.
 *
 * The count is /ticks page-room size: a socket in `page:<hostname>` is a
 * browser with a live card there, signed-in or not. It is NOT the site-chat
 * pool below — that one counts every reader with Poppin alive on the host,
 * card or no card — and the header prefers the pool whenever site chat is
 * available, falling back to this only when the feature is dark.
 *
 * null means "could not ask" — and null renders as NOTHING, everywhere. A
 * presence line that shows 0 tells every reader the place is dead; silence
 * makes the same page merely quiet. Both callers also hide counts below 2,
 * because a count of 1 is the reader themselves.

/**
 * PRESENCE IS THE POOL, AND THE POOL IS WHAT THE GATE READS.
 *
 * Everything below feeds `presence:site:<host>` on the backend — a Redis ZSET
 * of everyone with Poppin alive on a hostname right now
 * (apps/backend/src/site-chat/site-presence.service.ts). It is written merely
 * by BEING on the page. It is never written by entering or leaving the chat:
 * that is membership, it lives in a different key, and keeping the two apart
 * is what makes "once you are in you are never kicked out" buildable at all.
 *
 * WHY THE HEARTBEAT IS NOT IN THE SERVICE WORKER. Chrome evicts an MV3
 * background worker after a short idle and every setInterval dies with it,
 * silently freezing the one number the gate, the header pill and the chat's
 * own admission all consume — a frozen count is worse than no count, because
 * it looks like an answer. So the beat lives in real documents: the side panel
 * while it is open (components/Header.tsx) and the content script on the
 * active page (entries/contentScript/primary/main.tsx), with a coarse
 * chrome.alarms backstop in the background (entries/background/main.ts).
 *
 * SEVERAL WRITERS FOR ONE MEMBER IS SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION, not by
 * coordination: the server's write is ZADD keyed by member id, so a second
 * writer for the same member overwrites a score and the cardinality does not
 * move. That is the whole reason the panel, the page and the alarm may all
 * beat for the same reader without anyone counting them twice.

 * way by writing no presence at all: it never sends `hello` and never puts an
 * anonId in its handshake (helpers/siteChatTransport.ts:24-39). A socket that

 * verbatim (site-chat.controller.ts:169) — so two posts with two invented ids
 * raise the very count the admission gate reads
 * (site-membership.service.ts:157). Nothing in this file can close that: an
 * honest client cannot make a forgeable route unforgeable. The fix is
 * server-side — derive the member from something the caller cannot choose, or
 * count only ticketed identities toward SITE_CHAT_MIN_POPULATION — and it is
