 * saying under every chart. The alert is the product's cheapest promise:
 * park a number, get tapped on the shoulder, decide THEN.
 *
 * Same architecture as the fill watch, for the same reasons: the pure half
 * lives here under test, the chrome glue stays thin in the background, the
 * schedule is the existing alarm (an alert a minute late is still a tap on
 * the shoulder), and the browser-closed limit is the same — checked on next
 * start, late but never lost.
