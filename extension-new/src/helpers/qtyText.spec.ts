/**
 * "✓ $1.00 → 0 WBTC"
 *
 * A real purchase, on 2026-09-11. One dollar of Bitcoin at $78,968 is
 * 0.0000127 WBTC, and four fraction digits print that as zero. Money moved,
 * the chain agreed, and the only sentence the reader got said they had
 * received nothing.
 *
 * TradeHistory had already worked this out and written the reason down. The
 * inline buy under a tweet had its own copy of the formatter and its own
 * ceiling of four fraction digits. One rule now, in one place, because a rule
 * learned twice and applied once is not a rule.
