 * a reader, and sitting next to the risk facts it read as "small, be
 * careful" about wrapped Bitcoin.
 *
 * The catalog already knows which tokens these are — issuer 'wormhole' is
 * documented there as "Portal-wrapped collateral (WBTC, ETH), the reader's
 * real counterparty is the bridge holding the underlying". For those, the
 * figure is suppressed rather than relabelled: we do not hold the
 * underlying asset's cap, and inventing a qualifier for a number nobody
 * asked for is the info dump this line is being cut down for.

/**
 * THE GATE'S EVIDENCE, SAID OUT LOUD — one small line under the amount.
 *
 * Every open mint that reaches a sheet already passed the trade gate, which
 * read the pool's liquidity, its age, the holder count and the mint's
 * authorities — and then told the reader none of it. A degen deciding size
 * asks exactly these three numbers first ("LP ne kadar, kaç günlük, kaç
 * holder"), and today they alt-tab to a screener to learn what our own
 * server already knew.
 *
 * The words are the degen's own vocabulary on purpose — "LP", "holders",
 * "mint open" — because this row's readers taught them to us, and a gentler
 * paraphrase would read as marketing where a number was expected.
 *
 * RULES OF HONESTY, same family as the rest of the surface:
 * · A null field says NOTHING. Absent evidence is not "0 holders" and it is
 *   not "locked" — silence over either lie.
 * · All fields null → no line at all (`null`), never an empty shell.
 * · `warn` is true only for a fact that changes the risk NOW: a retained
 *   mint authority (the issuer can print) or a retained freeze authority
 *   (the issuer can take). Thin liquidity and young pools stay neutral ink —
 *   the gate already enforced the floors, and a second verdict in colour
 *   would be two governors for one door.
 * · "mint locked" is only said when Ultra POSITIVELY answered false; a
 *   reassurance derived from a missing field would be the exact lie the
 *   ticker cache used to tell about failures.
