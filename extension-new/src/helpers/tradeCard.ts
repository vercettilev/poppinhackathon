 * THE TRADE, AS A PICTURE WORTH POSTING.

 * Fomo's share card is the reference: asset up top, the movement in the
 * middle, the numbers below, the brand at the bottom carrying a hook. Ours
 * differs in one structural way that matters — the place this card lands
 * (X) is the place the product lives, so a viewer with the extension sees a
 * live chip under the very tweet the card rides in. The share IS the
 * funnel.
 *
 * Split in two so the interesting half is testable: `drawTradeCard` is
 * pure-ish canvas painting (specs run it against a recording context), and
 * `shareTradeCard` is the browser choreography — canvas → PNG → clipboard,
 * then the X composer with prefilled text. Copy-then-compose because X's
 * web intent accepts TEXT only; the image travels via paste, and the
 * receipt line tells the reader exactly that.

 * timeline is the exchange now, and that is either true or it is not.
 * Lowercase for the same reason emoji are banned from the card — the
 * register is a trader's post, not an announcement.
 *
 * @poppin_so rather than the bare word, because a mention is a door and a
 * word is not.
 *
 * SEVERAL, ROTATED, and that is a safety property rather than variety for
 * its own sake. Thousands of accounts posting one identical sentence with
 * one identical mention is the shape of coordinated behaviour, which is
 * the last thing to hand a ranking system while asking it to spread you.
 * Picked by a stable hash of the trade's own text, so re-sharing the same
 * pop never changes its wording.
 *
 * LINK-FREE still. X's own ranking weights outbound links poorly and reads
 * an at-mention beside a URL as spam; the address travels on the PNG.
