/**
 * WHAT A TRADE RECEIPT SAYS, in one place.
 *
 * Three surfaces now write receipts into the feed — the X chip, the page
 * card, and the wallet's Swap — and for a while the first two each carried
 * their own copy of this sentence. They drifted the moment one was
 * rewritten: the same trade said "PANTS $953 at $60.9M market cap" from the
 * chip and "Bought 1,074,603.6105 $PANTS ($953.00) on x.com via Poppin"
 * from the card, so one feed showed two products depending on where the
 * reader happened to press Buy. A third writer with a third copy would have
 * made that certain rather than likely.
 *
 * WHAT THE SENTENCE IS FOR. A reader of somebody else's trade wants the
 * SIZE OF THE BET and the SIZE OF THE THING. The quantity is nine digits
 * nobody can hold in their head, the verb is already on the tag above, and
 * the provenance is already announced by the card, so none of them are
 * here. Market cap is the memecoin-native unit — a price per token says
 * nothing on its own — and it is the trade's OWN, caught when it happened.
