/**
 * WHAT THE "YOU" PANEL SAYS, decided away from the DOM.
 *
 * The panel is a scoreboard: one big number, then what you hold and what
 * it is worth. All of that is arithmetic and rules about missing data, and
 * none of it is markup — so it lives here, where it can be argued with in
 * a test instead of read off a screenshot.
 *
 * ── THE ONE RULE THAT KEEPS COMING BACK ─────────────────────────────────
 * UNKNOWABLE IS NEVER ZERO. A position whose basis predates the ledger has
 * a null P&L, and printing "$0.00" for it tells a reader they broke even
 * when the truth is that nobody knows. Every field below is nullable for
 * that reason and every formatter answers "—" rather than a number it does
 * not have. This is the same rule `totalPnlUsd` was already documented
 * with; the panel just has more places to break it.
 */

/**
 * Deliberately as loose as the wire. Every priced field is optional AND
 * nullable, because a host that predates this panel sends none of them and
 * the server sends null for anything it could not price. One shape for
 * both, so nothing has to be normalised twice or asserted with `as`.
