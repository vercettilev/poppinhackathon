/**
 * WHAT THE STORE SHOWS IS SHIPPED FROM HERE, not typed into a dashboard.
 *
 * package.json's displayName and description become the extension's name and
 * short description in the Chrome Web Store, which means two house rules that
 * are enforced everywhere else in the product were being skipped on the one
 * surface a stranger reads first:
 *
 *   no em dashes in anything written for a reader, and
 *   no claim the product cannot keep.
 *
 * Both were being broken. The name carried an em dash and a line the product
 * retired months ago; the description promised "any coin", while the strip
 * trades what the catalog and the trade gate actually admit — a stranger
 * arriving on "$SOMETHING is not tradeable" after reading "any coin" was
 * promised something we do not do.
