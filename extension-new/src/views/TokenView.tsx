 * Every asset the panel knew was met sideways: a row in Positions, a strip
 * above a feed, a receipt in history — each carrying two or three of the
 * facts and a door to none of the rest. This is the room where they all
 * are: the header (price, 24h, MC, the gate's safety line), the chart with
 * the reader's own fills ON it, the trade sheet, the position if held, and
 * the reader's trades on this mint.
 *
 * REFUSES what by-mint refuses. The endpoint answers null for any mint §7
 * will not admit, and that verdict is time-varying — so an address that
 * cannot be described says so and offers nothing, exactly like the chip.
 *
 * The chart is the CHIP'S chart re-said in React: same series endpoint,
 * same geometry helpers (sparkGeometry/priceToY/timeToX), same honesty
 * about the two kinds of nothing. Deliberately line-only — candles live on
 * the chip today; parity is its own roadmap item.

            downgrade, which is the opposite of what a door is for.

            Unrealized first (what the OPEN position is doing), because
            that is the question somebody opens a token room to answer.
            Null is printed as a dash, never as zero: a position whose

            EVERY TRADE YOU HAVE MADE IN THIS TOKEN.

            `mine` was already fetched and already spent — on discs plotted
            in the chart. The list itself is the detail a feed row cannot
            carry and the reason to open a room: not "what is the price"
            but "what did I do here, and at what". Same rows, read twice.

            The executed price is printed only when the ledger knows it.
            A fill whose price was never recorded says so with a dash
            rather than being back-computed from dollars over quantity,
            which is an average and would read as a price.
