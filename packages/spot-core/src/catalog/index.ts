/**
 * The CURATED regime — P1 step one: tokenized equities.
 *
 * Two regimes now exist and they are not variations on each other. They answer
 * the same question ("may this mint be routed?") from opposite directions, and
 * the whole reason this file exists is to keep that boundary visible:
 *
 *   OPEN-MINT (§7, `safety/open-mint-gate.ts`)
 *     Anything may arrive. A mint earns its way through six measured criteria,
 *     and anything unknown counts against it. Trust is DERIVED, per mint, at
 *     request time, from what the chain and Jupiter report.
 *
 *   CURATED (this file)
 *     Nothing arrives on its own. A mint is here because a person put it here
 *     against a named issuer. Trust is DECLARED, in advance, and the review is
 *     the commit that added the row.
 *
 * Tokenized equities cannot pass the open-mint gate and never will, by
 * construction rather than by accident. Calibration on 2026-08-11/12 measured
 * it directly: SPCX, SPYx, CRCLx, NVDAx and MU ALL fail on
 * `mint_authority_retained` and `freeze_authority_retained`. That is not a
 * defect in them — an issuer of a security-backed token keeps those authorities
 * on purpose, because it has to be able to honour a corporate action, a
 * regulator, or a court. §7's criteria read a retained authority as "someone
 * can still rug you", which is the correct reading for an anonymous memecoin
 * and the wrong one here.
 *
 * So routing these through §7 would not be strict, it would be WRONG: it would
 * silently delete the entire category while reporting `failed_safety`, and the
 * telemetry would show a product that mysteriously never renders equities.
 *
 * What the curated regime is NOT:
 *
 *   Not a bypass with extra steps. Membership is the check. A mint that is not
 *   in this list gets nothing from this file — `CatalogPolicy` rejects it
 *   rather than falling through to a softer rule.
 *   Not an endorsement. These are third-party issuances with real issuer
 *   powers over holders' balances. That is disclosed, not defended.
 *   Not open to growth by inference. Nothing is added by a heuristic, a tag, or
 *   a name resembling one of these. Rows are added by hand, with the routability
 *   probe below run first.
 *
 * ADDING A ROW — the probe is not optional:
 *   1. Resolve the mint through Jupiter Ultra by SYMBOL and read what comes
 *      back. Do not type a mint address from memory or from a chat message.
 *      Symbol collision on Solana is not a corner case: on 2026-08-12 the query
 *      `SPCX` returned EIGHT exact-symbol matches and `SPYx` returned fifteen,
 *      nearly all impostors carrying the same ticker and, in several cases, the
 *      same display name. The verified flag and the liquidity are what separate
 *      them.
 *   2. Quote it both ways against USDC. An asset that can be entered and not
 *      exited is worse in this catalog than absent from it.
 *   3. Record the date and the observed numbers in the commit. Every mint below
 *      was probed on 2026-08-12; see PORTING.md for the table.

/**
 * Who issued the token and is therefore the party with the retained
 * authorities. Recorded per row because "tokenized equity" is not one thing:
 * these are separate issuers, separate programmes, separate terms, and a reader

 *
 * The two non-equity values follow the same principle applied to tokens:
 *   'native-spl'  a plain SPL token minted on Solana itself — the "issuer" is
 *                 the project's own mint, with no wrapping counterparty

 * and deliberately does NOT enforce counterparty ToU country lists — this is
 * not a second geofence, it is a disclosure plus a measurement.
 *
 * WHAT THE MEASUREMENT IS FOR. Nobody here knows whether these restrictions are
 * enforced at the mint — Token-2022 gives an issuer transfer hooks and a
 * permanent delegate, so they COULD be, and the terms say they are, but terms
 * and bytecode are different artefacts. A hard block guessed at from the terms
 * would refuse readers who would have transacted fine. Soft-applying answers

/**
 * THE TICKER PEOPLE WRITE, NOT THE ONE THE MINT CARRIES.
 *
 * BY_TICKER is keyed on `a.ticker`, which is the on-chain symbol. Nobody
 * types the on-chain symbol. Bitcoin is in this catalog as WBTC, so a
 * `$BTC` cashtag missed it entirely and fell through to open search, where
 * a memecoin squatting the ticker won — reported on 2026-09-11 as a chip
 * reading "BTC $0.01540 +81.7%" under a tweet about Bitcoin. Every
 * tokenized equity had the same hole: TSLAx, NVDAx, SPYx, QQQx and thirteen
 * more are unreachable by the four letters a reader actually writes.
 *
 * Two rules build the alias table, and both are deliberately narrow:
 *
 *   1. The xStocks suffix. `TSLAx` → `TSLA`. A strict naming convention, so
 *      this is structural and needs no per-entry curation.
 *   2. A term the ticker CONTAINS. `WBTC` lists 'BTC', `wXRP` lists 'XRP' —
 *      the wrapper conventions, caught without hardcoding a prefix. The
 *      containment test is what makes it safe: it admits 'BTC' for WBTC and
 *      refuses 'Starship' for SPCX, 'Tesla' for TSLAx and 'Nasdaq' for QQQx,
 *      which are brand names and belong to path C's entity matching, not to
 *      the cashtag door. Aliasing those would resolve `$STARSHIP` — a real
 *      and unrelated memecoin — to SpaceX.
 *
 * A REAL TICKER ALWAYS WINS. `$META` is MetaDAO, whose on-chain symbol is
 * literally META; the Meta xStock's derived `META` is dropped rather than
 * allowed to shadow it. And an alias claimed by two entries is dropped too,
 * which is the same rule the resolver already applies upstream: two
 * candidates is silence, not a coin flip.
